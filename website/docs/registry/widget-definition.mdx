Once you have [configured the registry](./config/declare-registry) it's time to create a widget definitions for one of
your components.

Imagine you have a _Toast Notification_ component, [like this one](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#toast-notifications). This is what it looks like in Storybook:

![Toast Notification in Storybook](../../static/img/storybook-toast.png)

## Widget Definition File
Widget definition files are the files matched by [the `register` pattern](config/options/register) in the registry
configuration. They usually match the pattern `*.widget.js`. So if we want to create a widget for the notification, we
will need to create `src/components/notification/toast-notification.widget.js`. This leaves us with:

```shell
src/components/notification/toast-notification.ts
src/components/notification/toast-notification.scss
// highlight-next-line
src/components/notification/toast-notification.widget.js
```

```js title="src/components/notification/toast-notification.widget.js"
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: path.join(__dirname, 'render-toast-notification.js'),
  shortcode: 'toast-notification',
  title: 'Toast Notification',
  description: 'A notification element with a bit more context than the inline notification.',
  status: 'wip'
};
```

All the options are described in the schema and documented in [its own documentation site](https://js-widgets.github.io/js-widgets/registry-schema/).
