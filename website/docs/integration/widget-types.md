:::info
This section focuses on the [Drupal integration](https://www.drupal.org/project/widget_instance). In the future other
CMS integrations may exist.
:::

Widget types in the CMS correspond to your [widget definition files](../registry/widget-definition) in your component
library. Once widget types are ingested in the CMS you will be able to embed them in pages and templates by creating
[widget instances](./widget-instances).
