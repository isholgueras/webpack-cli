Once you have configured the registry with [`.widgetRegistry/main.js`](./registry/summary) and created the
[widget definition (`*.widget.js`)](./registry/widget-definition), and the [render file](./registry/render-file), it's time to run the CLI
to compile all the widgets and create the registry JSON file.

## Compile the Registry
To get the CLI help information type:
```shell
npx @js-widgets/webpack-cli --help
```

By using `npx` we avoid having to install the CLI in our machine and keeping it up to date.

At the time of writing this the output was:

```title="npx @js-widgets/webpack-cli --help"
Usage: js-widgets-webpack-cli [options] <path>

Arguments:
  path                            Path to the project containing the .widgetRegistry directory.

Options:
  -v, --version                   output the version number
  -d, --debug                     output extra debugging
  --existing-registry <url>       HTTP URL to the existing registry. Used to get all the versions of all the widgets
                                  in this registry. Omit this to start a new registry from scratch.
  --output-dir <path>             a path to a directory where to save all the compiled widgets and the registry.
                                  CAUTION: the directory will be emptied.
  --omit-missing                  when used, widgets in the existing registry that cannot be found will not appear in
                                  the new registry.
  --new-version <version-string>  the new version for the widgets being compiled. If none provided a new version will
                                  be automatically generated if possible.
  -h, --help                      display help for command
```

Let's imagine your component library is at `/home/john/workspace/js/my-project-components`. This folder is where you
created the `.widgetRegistry` folder during [the initial setup](./registry/config/declare-registry).

<Tabs
  defaultValue='update'
  values={[
    { label: 'Create a Registry', value: 'create' },
    { label: 'Update a Registry', value: 'update' },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value='update'>
Once you already have a registry uploaded in a public location and it's being actively used, you need to provide it
to the CLI. This is so the automatic versioning process can guess the correct new version.

Widgets that exist in the provided registry that don't exist in the project being compiled will be copied over to the
newly created `registry.json`. If you don't want that to happen, use the `--omit-missing` flag.

```shell title="Compile without setting a version"
npx @js-widgets/webpack-cli \
  --existing-registry https://s3.acme.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/marketing-site/registry.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/widget-registry
```

When the `--new-version` option is omitted, the version will be calculated from the latest version in the widgets on the
existing registry.

:::note
There is a relationship between the value in `--existing-registry` and the
[`directoryUrl`](./registry/config/options/directoryUrl) that gets stored in the final `registry.json`.
:::
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='create'>
When you create the registry for the first time you don't have an `--existing-registry` to provide. If that is your case
you have three options:

  1. Create an empty registry in the desired location with an empty array: `[]`.
  1. Provide the URL where you _intend_ this registry to live.
  1. Omit the `--existing-registry` option. This requires the [`directoryUrl`](./registry/config/options/directoryUrl)
     option to contain a fully qualified URL.

```shell title="Compile without setting a version"
npx @js-widgets/webpack-cli \
  --existing-registry https://s3.acme.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/marketing-site/registry.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/widget-registry
  --new-version 1.0.0
```

If you omit the `--new-version` option on new registries, the initial version will be set to `0.1.0`.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Upload the Registry
Once the compilation process ends successfully, you need to upload the result to a public location of your choice. This
can be a cloud storage solution, a custom HTTP server, etc. The only requirement is that the files resulting from the
compilation need to be accessible via HTTP.

```title="Resulting files from the compilation example"
output
├── registry.json
└── widgets
    ├── inline-notification
    │   └── js
    │       └── main.js
    └── toast-notification
        └── js
            └── main.js
```
