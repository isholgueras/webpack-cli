# [2.0.0](https://github.com/js-widgets/webpack-cli/compare/v1.3.0...v2.0.0) (2021-12-07)


### Features

* webpack improvements ([#4](https://github.com/js-widgets/webpack-cli/issues/4)) ([5253c45](https://github.com/js-widgets/webpack-cli/commit/5253c45435511ffc96e06a7a52ec3c445db4980c))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* It also leverages webpack to create the `window.renderMyWidget = ...`. One only needs to export a function from now on. This is a breaking change, since render files need an export now.
