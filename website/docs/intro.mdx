## What are widgets?
Widgets types are **stand alone JavaScript applications** ready to use in any publishing context. JavaScript developers
create widgets in their own repositories, so they can be **syndicated and embedded** in publishing platforms. These
include popular CMS, static HTML, other JavaScript applications, etc.

<ImmediatelyAvailable
  alt="Immediately available"
  width="100%"
  style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}
/>

Build your digital strategy using widgets to maximize reuse of your development efforts. Widgets are designed to allow
you to focus on your strategy rather than on development.

## Develop widgets
Widgets can be as simple as a personalized CTA, or as complex as a full embedded product catalog. Widgets are a powerful
tool to build **reactive applications** that are stamped all across your digital properties.

### Configurable
Your widgets can accept external input. This can affect what the color scheme should be, what language should be used,
what is the personalized text for the call-to-action button, or what data source to use to fetch for content. This
allows you to maintain a **single code base powering many variants** without code duplication.

### i18n
Widgets are ready for **internationalization**. Both interface text and content can be expressed in your user's language.

<div className={styles.buttons}>
  <Link
    className="button button--secondary button--lg"
    to="https://github.com/js-widgets/example-widget">

</div>
