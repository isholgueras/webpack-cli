Widgets types are **stand alone JavaScript applications** ready to use in any publishing context. JavaScript developers
create widgets in their own repositories, so they can be **syndicated and embedded** in publishing platforms. These
include popular CMS, static HTML, other JavaScript applications, etc.

## Features
The most important feature is that widgets can be embedded **anywhere** in your CMS. This includes the layout building
tools, the content model relationships, the body field using the WYSIWYG editor, etc. This gives editors a lot more
power in building **amazing reactive content**.

Another significant feature is that you can put new JS apps (and update existing ones) without having to update the CMS.
Think of these JavaScript applications as you treat other media (images, videos, ...). You would not expect to have to
hard code your images/videos in your CMS templates, with the widget registry JS apps have the same editorial experience.

Build your digital strategy using widgets to maximize reuse of your development efforts. Widgets are designed to allow
you to focus on your strategy rather than on development.

## Develop widgets
Widgets can be as simple as a personalized CTA, or as complex as a full embedded product catalog. Widgets are a powerful
tool to build **reactive applications** that are stamped all across your digital properties.

### Configurable
Your widgets can accept external input. This can affect what the color scheme should be, what language should be used,
what is the personalized text for the call-to-action button, or what data source to use to fetch for content. This
allows you to maintain a **single code base powering many variants** without code duplication.

### i18n
Widgets are ready for **internationalization**. Both interface text and content can be expressed in your user's language.

<div className={styles.buttons}>
  <Link
    className="button button--secondary button--lg"
    to="https://github.com/js-widgets/example-widget">
